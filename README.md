# MaxSumPathFinder
Kind of dynamic programming problem

You will be given a triangle input and you need to find the path that provides the maximum possible sum of the numbers per the given rules below:  
1.	You will start from the top and move downwards to the last possible child.  
2.	You must proceed by changing between even and odd numbers subsequently. Suppose that you are on an even number, the next number you choose must be odd, or if you are on an odd number the next number must be even. In other words, the final path would be Odd -> even -> odd -> even â€¦  
3.	You must reach to the bottom of the pyramid.  
4.	Assume that there is at least one valid path to the bottom.  
5.	If there are multiple paths, which result in the same maximum amount, you can choose any of them.  
 
Sample Input:  
1  
8 9  
1 5 9  
4 5 2 3  
Output:  
Max sum: 16  
Path: 1, 8, 5, 2  Explanation:  
As you can see this triangle has several paths: 1->8->5->2, 1->9->9->3, 1->8->1->4, etc.  
The correct answer is 1 + 8 + 5 + 2 = 16. Because since 1 (top most number) is odd we cannot step onto 9 because 9 is an odd number too. The only number we can move to is 8. From 8 we can step to 1 or 5. Only 1 -> 8 -> 5 -> 2 sequence gives us the maximum sum. The other path 1-> 8 -> 1 -> 4 is also a valid path but it sums up to 14. Since 16 is greater than 14, 16 is the solution. Also, note that the solution is in the form of odd > even > odd > even.  

Question:  
Per the above rules, what is the maximum sum of the below input? Please take this pyramid as an input (as a file, or constants directly inside the code) for your implementation and solve it.  215

330 131 333 928 376 733 017 778 839 168 197 197  
131 171 522 137 217 224 291 413 528 520 227 229 928  
223 626 034 683 839 052 627 310 713 999 629 817 410 121  
924 622 911 233 325 139 721 218 253 223 107 233 230 124 233  
Note that, each node has only two children here (except the bottom row). As an example, you can walk from 215 to 124 or 192, and then from 124 to 269, since 442 is even just like its parent. From 124 you cannot go to 117 because it is not a direct child of 124.
